# MATLAB Data Analysis: 5 Case Studies with Scenario Comparison
Welcome to the MATLAB Data Analysis Repository! This repository contains MATLAB scripts and datasets for analyzing and visualizing performance metrics in five distinct case studies, comparing scenarios A and B.

## Case Studies
1. **Static Case Study**
   - Scenario A vs. Scenario B under static conditions.
   
2. **Sparsely Populated Case Study**
   - Scenario A vs. Scenario B in sparsely populated environments.

3. **Slower Case Study**
   - Scenario A vs. Scenario B in slower conditions.

4. **Faster Case Study**
   - Scenario A vs. Scenario B in faster conditions.

5. **Densely Populated Case Study**
   - Scenario A vs. Scenario B in densely populated settings.

## Repository Contents
- MATLAB scripts for data analysis.
- Datasets used in the case studies.
- Graphs, histograms, and visualizations.
- Final report (not included in this repository).
